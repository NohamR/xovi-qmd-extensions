# Xovi Extensions

This repo consists of multiple xovi (.qmd) extensions that are QoL improvements to the xochitl interface. These require [qt-resource-rebuilder](https://github.com/asivery/rm-xovi-extensions/tree/master/qt-resource-rebuilder) to work.

Instructions to install xovi can be found [here](https://github.com/asivery/rmpp-xovi-extensions/blob/master/INSTALL.MD). 

Download the extensions from the folder matching your reMarkable software version. 

Copy the `.qmd` files to `/home/root/xovi/exthome/qt-resource-rebuilder/` and restart xovi.

Some of the QMD files in this repo are my own and some are modifications I've made to extensions created by others in the community. Modifications will link to the original author.

Extensions have been tested only for the latest reMarkable OS version, though they may work on newer versions.

Beta releases are not tested nor supported.
